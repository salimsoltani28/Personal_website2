My doctoral research explores the potential of Machine Learning utilization for the detection of plant species using high-resolution remote sensing data. In this research framework, I am following the below research axises:

Exploiting machine and deep learning specifically Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) capabilities for detection of plant species using high-resolution Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), Airborn, and satellite data.
Exploring CNN and high-resolution data effectiveness and limitations for accurate detection of plant spatial distribution and identification of its influential factors.
